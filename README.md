# Progressive Tetonic

github page for Pietra's plug in

This is Pietra's final thesis project instructed by Mark Ericson. It starts by looking at our current paradigm in designing social housing that is derived from the modernist idea of a well planned city and buildings. This authoritarian design creates one solution fits all which ignores the human qualities of the urban fabric and the specific local conditions.

Iâ€™m creating a  plugin that shifts the role of architects as designers into system designers, thus, giving more agency in the decision-making of the final form of the building to the users. It allows for anyone to generate a collective housing form that is a loose system made out of autonomously linked parts which signifies an open-ended system of incremental growth.
